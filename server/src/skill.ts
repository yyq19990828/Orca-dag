// Why the viewer does this at all: the project has two halves that are useless
// apart — the skill teaches your agent to *build* the DAG, the viewer *runs* it
// — and making people install them separately is one step too many. So
// `npx orca-orchestration-launcher` installs the skill on startup and then serves the UI. One
// command, everything works.
//
// It is deliberately dumb and idempotent: write the file, don't touch anything
// else. No symlinks (they break when the npx cache is evicted), no agent config
// edits, no network. Opt out with `--no-skill` / `ORCA_DAG_NO_SKILL=1`.
